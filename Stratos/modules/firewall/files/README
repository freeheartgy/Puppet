This directory contains scripts to add and flush Iptables rules.

Whenever you need to run a new rule or change an existing one, it's recommended that
you run the "flush.sh" first and execute "firewall.sh". If you are running these
scripts on a new server, set IFACE and INERADDR variables accordingly and execute 
the script.
